===
## Contributing code
Please fork the repo and [Create A Pull Request](https://github.com/RedstoneLamp/RedstoneLamp/pulls). Please be sure of the following before you start writing code:
 * The code should use the [Eclipse Luna Custom Formatter](https://github.com/RedstoneLamp/RedstoneLamp/blob/master/Contributing/RedstoneLamp%20Formatter.xml)
 * If you are implementing a new feature, please make sure it exists in our TODO list or fixes a bug in the software. (Can be found [HERE](https://github.com/RedstoneLamp/RedstoneLamp/blob/master/README.md))
 * If the TravisCI build fails (It will show you with a red X or a green check mark) please fix the code ASAP. We will close failed PRs as soon as we see them!

## Creating issues
 * Must be strictly issues with RedstoneLamp.
 * Do NOT spam the issues. People receive emails when posts are made.
 * STAY ON TOPIC!
